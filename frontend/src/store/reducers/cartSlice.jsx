// Reducers contains those synchronus actions which are going to 
// change initialState. Reducers can hold only synchronus data only


// state.carts = action.payload;
// > state is the current Redux state for this slice (for example: { carts: [] }).
// > action.payload is the data you pass when you call dispatch(loadcart(data)).
// > state.carts = action.payload means:
//   "Replace the carts array in the state with the data that Iâ€™m passing."
